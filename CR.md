**Neko v2rayNG Privacy Policy**

This policy will be effective from November 17, 2023

2dust builds the Neko v2rayNG application as an open source application. The Service is provided free of charge by 2dust and is intended to be used as is.

Neko v2rayNG respects and protects the personal privacy rights of all users, and for this reason we disclose this privacy policy to the public. **Your use of Neko v2rayNG means that you have read and agreed to these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, please stop using and uninstall Neko v2rayNG immediately. **

**collect message**

The Neko v2rayNG software itself will not send any information to the developer, but the application market (such as Google Play) where you download the software may collect relevant information about the running status of the application and provide it to the Neko v2rayNG developer. For this information, please read the privacy policy provided by the app store you use.

The Neko v2rayNG software may contain features that require unlocking through IAP payment, and your payment information will be processed by the relevant IAP channel, and we have no access to the payment information.

When you report an error in software operation to Neko v2rayNG developers, the developer may ask you to provide software and system logs to help confirm the cause of the problem. Since the logs may contain sensitive information, such information can only be sent by yourself. **We do not make any express or implied guarantees about the security and privacy of any transmission service. Please choose a method that is acceptable to you when transmitting relevant information. **

**Information Sharing**

We do not sell collected user data to any third party. We may provide information to outside developers to assist in the development of software, but we will communicate relevant confidentiality obligations and determine that they can be complied with before providing the information.

**Information Retention**

Unless there are relevant legal requirements, we will delete user data that is no longer needed within 30 days, or consolidate the statistical data into a comprehensive report that cannot identify individual users.

**Information leaked**

We will use reasonable technology and security means to try our best to protect user data, but we cannot guarantee the absolute security of data. If we confirm that a data breach has occurred, we will notify users through available channels within 7 days. **You agree not to hold us responsible for any losses caused by force majeure. **

**Childrenâ€™s Privacy**

The Services are not directed to anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will promptly delete that information from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I can take necessary action.

**Terms Modification**

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy, but will ensure that users are notified through our available channels and in-app prompts at least 30 days before updating the terms. **Continuing to use the software after the new terms take effect constitutes your agreement to the revised Privacy Policy. **
